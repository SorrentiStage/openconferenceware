# = Capistrano deployment for OpenConferenceWare instances
#
# To deploy the application using Capistrano, you must:
#
#  1. Install Capistrano and the multistage extension on your local machine:
#       sudo gem install capistrano capistrano-ext
#
#  2. Create or use a stage file as defined in the "config/deploy/" directory.
#     Read the other files in that directory for ideas. You will need to use
#     the name of your configuration in all remote calls. E.g., if you created
#     a "config/deploy/mysite.rb" (thus "mysite"), you will run commands like
#     "cap mysite deploy" to deploy using your "mysite" configuration.
#
#  3. Setup your server if this is the first time you're deploying, e.g.,:
#       cap mysite deploy:setup
#
#  4. Create the "shared/config/secrets.yml" on your server to store secret
#     information. See the "config/secrets.yml.sample" file for details. If you
#     try deploying to a server without this file, you'll get instructions with
#     the exact path to put this file on the server.
#
#  5. Create the "shared/config/database.yml" on your server with the database
#     configuration. This file must contain absolute paths if you're using
#     SQLite. If you try deploying to a server without this file, you'll get
#     instructions with the exact path to put this file on the server.
#
#  6. Push your revision control changes and then deploy, e.g.,:
#       cap mysite deploy
#
#  7. If you have migrations that need to be applied, deploy with them, e.g.,:
#       cap mysite deploy:migrations
#
#  8. If you deployed a broken revision, you can rollback to the previous, e.g.,:
#       cap mysite deploy:rollback
