OpenConferenceWare
==================


About
-----

*OpenConferenceWare* is an open source web application for events and
conferences. This customizable, general-purpose platform provides
proposals, sessions, schedules, tracks and more.


Why
---

By releasing this code under a liberal MIT open source license, we hope
to empower other people so they can better organize and participate in
more events that support free sharing of information, open society, and
involved citizenry.


Releases
--------

The stable releases this software are tagged with version numbers,
such as "v0.20090416", that represent the date they were made.
There is also a "stable" branch that points to the current stable
release. The [CHANGES.txt](CHANGES.txt) file describes a summary of
significant changes made between stable releases.

The code works well and is being used in production on multiple sites.
However, it is under heavy development, documentation is scant, tests
are incomplete, and the sample theme is broken. These issues are being
resolved, but the main focus is currently adding features to support the
needs of Open Source Bridge and Linux Plumbers Conference. It is
strongly recommended that you have access to an experienced Ruby on
Rails developer if you intend to use this software.

If you need a simpler system for accepting proposals for Ignite-like
events, please consider the stable and well-tested software this code
was forked from: OpenProposals,
<http://OpenProposals.org/>

Expertise
---------

Installing the app requires familiarity with *UNIX* system administration
and *Ruby on Rails*. This application will run best on a UNIX-based
dedicated server or virtual machine, and may not run at all on cheap
shared hosting because these often limit memory usage below the minimum
threshold for this application. You will need to install software that
this application depends on either as root or compile it yourself. You
will need to setup an application server to run the application, e.g.,
`mod_passenger`. If you do not have these skills, contact your local Ruby
or Linux user group and you will likely find someone that can help.


Dependencies
------------

1. Install Git: <http://git.or.cz/>

2. Checkout the OpenConferenceWare source code:

        git clone git://github.com/igal/openconferenceware.git

3. Install Ruby 1.8.6 or 1.8.7 from [ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/](ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/) or Ruby Enterprise Edition from [http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/download.html](http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/download.html)

4. Install RubyGems 1.3.x: <http://rubyforge.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=28071>

5. Install Bundler:

        sudo gem install bundler

6. Install other Ruby libraries from within the checkout directory:

        bundle check || bundle install

Setup
-----

Run the application's interactive setup program from within the checkout
directory, and follow its instructions:

        rake setup


Security
--------

This application runs with insecure settings by default to make it easy
to get started. These default settings include publicly-known
cryptography keys that can allow attackers to gain admin privileges to
your application. You should create a `config/secrets.yml` file with
your secret settings if you intend to run this application on a server
that can be accessed by untrusted users, read the
[config/secrets.yml.sample](config/secrets.yml.sample) file for details.


Customization
-------------

You can customize the application's appearance and behavior by creating
a theme, read the [themes/README.txt](themes/README.txt) file.

WARNING: The methods and instance variables used within the theme's
application layout are in a state of flux as the software grows. These
will be stablized for the 1.0 release. In the meantime, please
watch the changes made to the bridgepdx theme's layout and incorporate
them into your own, e.g.:

        git log -p themes/bridgepdx/layouts/application.html.erb


Deployment
----------

If you wish to deploy your application using Capistrano, read the
[config/deploy.rb](config/deploy.rb) file.
